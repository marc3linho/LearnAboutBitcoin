## WHAT IS BITCOIN 
Bitcoin is money that works without a company or government behind it.
It's a technology like the internet.

You can own fractions of a bitcoin called satoshi: 

1 btc = 100,000,000 satoshi

Read the **BITCOIN WHITE PAPER** - https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

```
No need to JOIN Bitcoin!
```

It's an open network that anyone can use without permission.

- Bitcoin doesn't promise profits.
- Bitcoin's price is volatile. Save it for 4-5 years or spend it immediately. 

Use Cases
- Earn Bitcoin (online work, podcasting, gaming, become a developer...)
- Receive remittances (low fees)
- Pay locally and abroad (low fees)
- Ask your local shops accept bitcoin

## OWN YOUR MONEY
You **don't need** a bank, permission, identification, or to be wealthy to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin can not be inflated, forged, or stopped by anyone.

Your Bitcoin is harder to steal than cash.
Your payments can't be censored.
Your Bitcoin can't be frozen like a bank account.
But **ONLY** if you have the backup/keys (12/24 words[^1])
With these your bitcoin are **YOURS** alone!

This is called self-custody or non-custodial.
Open the page and you'll find installation guides for self-custodial wallets.  

```
Self-custody:
Your keys, your bitcoin.
Be your own bank!
```

If you buy bitcoin at an exchange or use a custodial wallet, it's like money in the bank.
It can be frozen, it can be lost, what you own an what you do with your money can be tracked. This is called custodial.

```
Custody:
Not your keys, not your bitcoin!
```

Use bitcoin in self-custody as shown in this brochure and use it with your family, friends and business partners.

**NEVER SHARE** your backup/keys with anyone or store them digital or make screenshots.

## FIXED SUPPLY

The US Dollar, Euro or other Currency have an infinite supply, but Bitcoin's supply is limited to < 21 million bitcoin, ever!
